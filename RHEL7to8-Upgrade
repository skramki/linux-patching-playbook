RHEL7 to RHEL8 Upgrade POC
-------------------------------------
1) Ensure the successfull backup is taken for the Upgrade performing server

2) Ensure RHEL 7 uptodate patches repo should be  available in the client server and patch the server upto date

3) Install leapp packages installed in the server  
--------
python2-leapp-0.16.0-1.el7_9.noarch
leapp-deps-0.16.0-1.el7_9.noarch
leapp-rhui-aws-1.0.7-1.el7.noarch
leapp-upgrade-el7toel8-deps-0.19.0-1.el7_9.noarch
leapp-upgrade-el7toel8-0.19.0-1.el7_9.noarch
leapp-0.16.0-1.el7_9.noarch
-----------


4)sudo yum versionlock clear --> to clear the version lock

5)sudo leapp preupgrade --no-rhsm  --target 8.9    (here --no-rhsm is used for clients without subscription-manager )
 
Analyse the report from the /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt  and fix the Errors and Inhibitors mainly which obstructs the upgrade through leapp



Remediations applied/followed for the below errors
----------------------------------
i) Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: Package "leapp-rhui-aws" is missing
Summary: On AWS using RHUI infrastructure, a package "leapp-rhui-aws" is needed for in-place upgrade
Remediation: [command] yum install -y leapp-rhui-aws 


ii) Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: The pam_tally2 pam module(s) no longer available
Summary: The services system-auth-ac using PAM are configured to use pam_tally2 module(s), which is no longer available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
Remediation: [hint] If you depend on its functionality, it is recommended to migrate to pam_faillock. Otherwise please remove the pam module(s) from all the files under /etc/pam.d/.

-->Comment the configurations in the files in the /etc/pam.d which has pam_tally2 enabled


iii)Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: Using RHSM has been skipped but no custom or RHUI repositories have been delivered.
Summary: Leapp is run in the mode when the Red Hat Subscription Manager is not used (the --no-rhsm option or the LEAPP_NO_RHSM=1 environment variable has been set) so leapp is not able to obtain YUM/DNF repositories with the content for the target system in the standard way. The content has to be delivered either by user manually or, in case of public clouds, by a special Leapp package for RHUI environments.
Remediation: [hint] Create the repository file according to instructions in the referred document on the following path with all repositories that should be used during the upgrade: "/etc/leapp/files/leapp_upgrade_repositories.repo"

--> Create a /etc/leapp/files/leapp_upgrade_repositories.repo and add the rhel8 repo in the file

iv) Risk Factor: high (error)
Title: Not enough space available on /var/lib/leapp/scratch: Needed at least 4096 MiB.
Summary: {"detail": "The file system hosting the /var/lib/leapp/scratch directory does not contain enough free space to proceed all parts of the in-place upgrade. Note the calculated required free space is the minimum derived from upgrades of minimal systems and the actual needed free space could be higher.\nNeeded at least: 4096 MiB.\nSuggested free space: 5096 MiB (or more)."}

v)
  File "/usr/share/leapp-repository/repositories/system_upgrade/common/libraries/mounting.py", line 345, in _create
    raise MountError('Failed to create mount target directory {}'.format(directory), str(e))
MountError: Failed to create mount target directory /var/lib/leapp/scratch/mounts/root_/system_overlay/var/log/audit

--> for both 4 & 5 type of errors, Mount atleast 8GB partition as ext4 as /var/lib/leapp will resolve 

vi) Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: Leapp detected loaded kernel drivers which have been removed in RHEL 8. Upgrade cannot proceed.
Summary: Support for the following RHEL 7 device drivers has been removed in RHEL 8:
     - floppy
     - pata_acpi

---> Remove the modules 
sudo modprobe -r pata_acpi
sudo modprobe -r floppy

vii) Risk Factor: high 
Title: SSSD Domain "<DOMAIN_NAME>": sudo rules containing wildcards will stop working.
Summary: Default value of ldap_sudo_include_regexp changed from true to false for performance reason.
Remediation: [hint] If you use sudo rules with wildcards, set this option to true explicitly.

--> Remove the wildcard(*) in the sudoers rules
 
viii) Risk Factor: low 
Title: SElinux will be set to permissive mode
Summary: SElinux will be set to permissive mode. Current mode: enforcing. This action is required by the upgrade process to make sure the upgraded system can boot without beinig blocked by SElinux rules.
Remediation: [hint] Make sure there are no SElinux related warnings after the upgrade and enable SElinux manually afterwards. Notice: You can ignore the "/root/tmp_leapp_py3" SElinux warnings.

-->Disable the selinux by "sudo setenforce 0"

ix)Risk Factor: high (error)
Title: Unable to install RHEL 8 userspace packages.
Summary: {"details": "Command ['systemd-nspawn', '--register=no', '--quiet', '-D', '/var/lib/leapp/scratch/mounts/root_/system_overlay', '--setenv=LEAPP_UPGRADE_PATH_TARGET_RELEASE=8.6', '--setenv=LEAPP_NO_RHSM=1', '--setenv=LEAPP_EXPERIMENTAL=0', '--setenv=LEAPP_UPGRADE_PATH_FLAVOUR=default', '--setenv=LEAPP_COMMON_TOOLS=:/etc/leapp/repos.d/system_upgrade/common/tools:/etc/leapp/repos.d/system_upgrade/el7toel8/tools', '--setenv=LEAPP_NO_RHSM_FACTS=1', '--setenv=LEAPP_COMMON_FILES=:/etc/leapp/repos.d/system_upgrade/common/files:/etc/leapp/repos.d/system_upgrade/el7toel8/files',  'subscription-manager'] failed with exit code 1.",

6)Proceed the leapp upgrade to the target version and once it successfull, reboot  the servers and perform post migration checks
